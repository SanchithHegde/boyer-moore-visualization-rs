# Boyer-Moore String Matching

Rust implementation of the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm, for educational purposes. My
previous Python implementation, done as part of an academic project can be found
[here](https://github.com/SanchithHegde/boyer-moore-visualization-python).

The visualization works on terminals that support ANSI escape sequences. A font that supports
Unicode characters (for example, [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)) is also required.

## Running

The binary can be run in debug mode using `cargo run`. Optionally, to run in release mode with
optimizations, use the `--release` flag.
